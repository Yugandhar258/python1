            Also the sum of them will be printed next to the upward faces.
            If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first roll, you win.
            If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll, you lose.
            If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first roll, that sum becomes your "point".
            To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you make your point again.
            You lose if u get the sum as 7 before making your point.
